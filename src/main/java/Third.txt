First of all - you have really CRITICAL problem with environment, its not okay if it can handle only one test suite at a time.

Second - right answer for question "Please suggest possible solutions how to ensure integration tests will always pass" is - comment your tests content.
    Better question is "Please suggest possible solutions how to ensure that app integration works fine using automation tests" or so
     (we want product to be good, not tests to be green right? :) ).

You can go two ways:
    * increase potential of that test en instance to be able to handle multiple app instances
        + pros:
            + you feel's like a god using 64-128 cores machine
        - cons:
            - seems like hard to do
            - if that node is offline, all your app instances cant be tested with integration suite
            - if we have to deal with same data accessed from multiple consumers, there probably will be some mess with it, which are hard to track
            - you will need to spend extra time every time when quantity of app instances increasing
    * increate quantity of test environment instances (separate for each app will be great)
        + pros:
            + that makes every app instance + test env instance pair independent from all the others, which in qa world is always great
            + after standartizing process for deploying new test env instance it will be easy to scale test environment for any number of app instances
            + in case of failure of one test instance that probably easy to run new one (or take other app instance test env for a while? please :) )
        - cons:
            - probably will take more time to create documentation, and develop whole process to deploy new test env instance from scratch
